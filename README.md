# SimonGame

The old and wounderful game that make your brain to be worked harder! You can try it now!

# Rules

Press  Any button. Simon will give the first signal. Repeat the signal by pressing the same color lens.<br>

Simon will  add one. Repeat these two signals by pressing the same color lenses, in order.<br>

Simon will once again add one and so on.<br>

If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, Simon responds with a "RAZZ" sound. This means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends.<br>
